# Bank Loan Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data using a combination of Power BI for dashboard creation and SQL Server for querying the dataset. By leveraging these tools, we aim to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for making informed business decisions in the banking sector.

# Project Overview:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze bank loan data to extract valuable insights and performance metrics. By visualizing the data through Power BI dashboards and employing SQL queries to extract specific information from the dataset, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of loan applications and their outcomes.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- [x] Total Loan Applications: The total number of loan applications received by the bank.
- [x] Total Funded Amount: The total amount of funds disbursed as loans.
- [x] Total Amount Received as EMI: The total amount received by the bank as Equated Monthly Installments (EMI).
- [x] Average Interest Rate: The average interest rate charged on the loans disbursed.
- [x] Average Debt-to-Income Ratio: The average ratio of debt to income for loan applicants.
- [x] Good Loan Applicants: Applicants categorized as "good" based on predefined criteria indicating low default risk.
- [x] Bad Loan Applicants: Applicants categorized as "bad" based on predefined criteria indicating high default risk.

# Tools Used:
- [x] Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- [x] SQL Server: For querying the loan dataset and extracting relevant information.
- [x] Excel: For data exploration.
- [x] GitHub: For version control and collaboration.

# Files Included:
- [x] loan_data.sql: SQL script containing queries to retrieve and manipulate loan data.
- [x] Bank_Loan_Dashboard.pbix: Power BI file containing the dashboard visualizations.
- [x] README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
